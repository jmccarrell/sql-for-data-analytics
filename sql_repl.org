NB: one can also do this kind of thing at [[http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/acbf1/3][sql fiddle]]

** play with casting percentages so they look good on output

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select cast(1 * 100.0 / 3 as decimal(18, 4)) as n
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
|       n |
|---------|
| 33.3333 |

** work with histograms

*** here are 10k random integers counted and binned into 20 bins
    #+begin_src sql
      WITH data(value) AS (
          SELECT trunc(random() * 100)+1 FROM generate_series(1,10000)
      ), buckets as (
          SELECT value, width_bucket(value, 1, 101, 20) as bucket
          FROM data
      )
      select bucket
             , max(count(1))
               over (partition by bucket)
        from buckets
       group by bucket
    #+end_src
